# Covid-Beyond-Tweets
Social Data Science Project

I will be collecting tweets from Politicians (senators) from 2020 to explore their top terms during the pandemic. 

(STILL IN THE WORKS) I plan to preprocess these tweets to do some exploratory analysis, look at the most common co-occurring words, and perform sentiment analysis.

[Check out what I have so far] (https://andreaglopez.shinyapps.io/covid-beyond-tweets/?_ga=2.133299912.739161005.1638824123-92550555.1636514235)
