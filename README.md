# Covid-Beyond-Tweets
Social Data Science Project

I will be collecting tweets from Politicians (senators) from 2020 to explore their top terms during the pandemic. 

(STILL IN THE WORKS) I plan to preprocess these tweets to do some exploratory analysis, look at the most common co-occurring words, and perform sentiment analysis.

** It appears that some senators twitter handles are not right and no information have been collected for them

Goals: 

* Learn how to use Twitter API
*
