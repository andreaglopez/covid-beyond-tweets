# Covid-Beyond-Tweets
Social Data Science Project

Hi there!

This project consisted of using tweets from sitting Senators from March (beginning of lockdown) to the rest of 2020 to explore their top terms during the pandemic. 

My goal was to see if there top words (positive/negative) had any relationship to how vaccination rate in their state are high/low currently.
